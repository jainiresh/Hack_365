# TOPIC
The final wrap up read for Sales force deployment's security configurations.

# REASON OF THE PAST 2 WORKS
You may be wondering, that the past 3 topics about salesforce are irrelevant, to hunting bugs and ethical hacking.
These three posts are meant for the Blue Team, who are in constant development towards defense against the Red Team.
It's equally important to focus on the Blue Team, like the Red Team.
A hacker not only knows how to attack a website or a system, on all its side, but also to defend them in case his
own website was at fault.
