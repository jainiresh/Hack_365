DOCKER ENV - PIVOTING AND EXPLOITING THEM

# EXPLOITS AND EXPLANATIONS
Watch  the link in the below REFERENCES section.

This video is about pentesting a docker environment, and first finding them and then fingerprinting and exploiting them.

A nmap scan is run on the target iP.
We come to know that the target IP has a ssh shell port open, we use this as a leverage and we connect our local computer
with the remote target IP computer.

Using the ssh command , we gain access to the remote iP machine, and we soon find out that, there is a docker machine
running on it.
