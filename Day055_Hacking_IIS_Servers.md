HACKING IIS SERVERS

# WHAT IS AN IIS SERVER ?
Like Apache, Tomcat , IIS are servers developed my Microsoft.
They run on windows and is the second most used web server on the internet.
Most asp and aspx websites are hosted on the IIS servers.

They are general purpose web servers, that respond with HTML pages on request.
It accepts request from remote client servers, and respond with appropriate HTML pages.
 (Internet Information Services) IIS


# IIS SHORT NAME SCANNER
https://github.com/sw33tLie/sns (Go)
https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner (Java)

These tools are used to scan and find the short names of the files, which are present in the SHORT NAME FORMAT in the
IIS server.

Microsoft WINDOWS store all the long filenames, in a short format with a tilde character (~).
The flaw is that, the IIS server triggers the issue when parsing the ~ character.
