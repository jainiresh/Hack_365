# ENUMERATION
- Really easy to emurate
We can enumerate to the ssh port using a simple command of netcat like
```
nc 10.10.10.10 22
```
and we get the enumeration.

# COMMAND

## LOGGING IN
```
local:~$ ssh bob@10.10.10.10
...
bob@remote:~$ whoami
bob

local:~$ ssh@10.10.10.10 whoami
bob
```

## COPYTING FILES
### UPLOADING FILE TO REMOTE SYSTEM
```
scp malware bob@10.10.10.10:~/bin/not-malware

```
### DOWNLOAD FILE FROM REMOTE SYSTEM
```
scp bob@10.10.10.10:/etc/secret/sauce ./loot/secret
```

### RECURSIVE -r
```
scp -r bob@10.10.10.10:/etc/secret ./loot/
```

# LOCAL FORWARDING
This is a technique where we connect to a proxy or a server or a firewall before the actual server that we intend to connect to.
By doing this the actual server thinks that the request to it comes from the proxy server or the server that we first connected.

```
ssh -L 8080:192.168.1.10:80 bob@10.10.10.10 -N
```
